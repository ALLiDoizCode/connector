# Multi-Hop ILP Network Deployment - Summary

## Overview

A complete multi-hop ILP (Interledger Protocol) network deployment system that creates 5 production peers with unique ILP addresses, funds them from a base treasury wallet using claim-based settlement, and verifies multi-hop packet routing.

## What Was Created

### 1. Deployment Infrastructure

**Main Deployment Script: `scripts/deploy-5-peer-multihop.sh`**

- Automated 6-step deployment process
- Checks prerequisites (Docker, images, environment)
- Starts 5-peer network
- Funds peers from treasury wallet
- Sends test packet through all 5 hops
- Verifies multi-hop routing behavior
- Color-coded console output with status indicators

**Docker Compose Configuration: `docker-compose-5-peer-multihop.yml`**

- 5 ILP connector services (peer1-peer5)
- Anvil local blockchain for testing
- Health checks for all services
- Environment variable injection
- Network isolation with Docker bridge network

### 2. Peer Configuration Files

**Location:** `examples/multihop-peer*.yaml`

Each peer has:

- Unique ILP address (g.peer1 through g.peer5)
- BTP server configuration
- Peer connection definitions
- Routing tables for multi-hop forwarding

**Topology:**

```
Peer1 (Entry) → Peer2 (Transit) → Peer3 (Middle) → Peer4 (Transit) → Peer5 (Exit)
```

### 3. Funding Utility

**Tool: `tools/fund-peers/`**

Features:

- Fund peers from treasury wallet with ETH and ERC20 tokens
- Auto-generate peer wallets if not provided
- Parallel funding transactions for efficiency
- Detailed logging of funding operations
- TypeScript CLI with commander interface

**Usage:**

```bash
cd tools/fund-peers
npm install && npm run build
npm run fund -- --peers peer1,peer2,peer3,peer4,peer5 \
  --eth-amount 0.1 \
  --token-amount 1000
```

**Updated: `.env.example`**

Added sections for:

- BTP authentication secrets
- Comments explaining purpose and usage

## Network Architecture

### ILP Addresses

Each peer has a unique address in the global ILP address space:

- `g.peer1` - Entry node (receives external packets)
- `g.peer2` - Transit node 1
- `g.peer3` - Transit node 2 (middle)
- `g.peer4` - Transit node 3
- `g.peer5` - Exit node (destination)

### BTP Connections

Bilateral Transfer Protocol connections follow the linear chain:

```
Peer1:3000 ←─── Peer2 (initiates connection)
Peer2:3001 ←─── Peer3 (initiates connection)
Peer3:3002 ←─── Peer4 (initiates connection)
Peer4:3003 ←─── Peer5 (initiates connection)
```

Each peer:

- Runs a BTP server on its designated port
- Initiates client connections to upstream peers (except Peer1)
- Accepts incoming connections from downstream peers (except Peer5)

### Routing Tables

**Longest-Prefix Matching Algorithm:**

When a packet arrives with destination `g.peer5.dest`:

1. **Peer1** routing table:
   - Match: `g.peer5` → nextHop: `peer2`
   - Forward to Peer2

2. **Peer2** routing table:
   - Match: `g.peer5` → nextHop: `peer3`
   - Forward to Peer3

3. **Peer3** routing table:
   - Match: `g.peer5` → nextHop: `peer4`
   - Forward to Peer4

4. **Peer4** routing table:
   - Match: `g.peer5` → nextHop: `peer5`
   - Forward to Peer5

5. **Peer5** routing table:
   - Match: `g.peer5` → nextHop: `peer5` (local delivery)
   - Deliver locally, return FULFILL

## Multi-Hop Packet Flow

### PREPARE Packet (Forward Path)

```
Client → Peer1 → Peer2 → Peer3 → Peer4 → Peer5
```

**Each hop performs:**

1. Validates packet structure and expiry
2. Looks up next-hop via longest-prefix matching
3. Decrements expiry time (1 second safety margin)
4. Optionally calculates connector fee
5. Records settlement transfer (if enabled)
6. Forwards packet to next-hop via BTP

**Destination (Peer5):**

1. Recognizes local delivery (nextHop = self)
2. Validates execution condition
3. Generates FULFILL with preimage
4. Returns FULFILL to Peer4

### FULFILL Packet (Return Path)

```
Peer5 → Peer4 → Peer3 → Peer2 → Peer1 → Client
```

**Each hop:**

1. Verifies fulfillment matches execution condition
2. Updates settlement records
3. Forwards FULFILL upstream

## Treasury Funding

### Process

1. **Treasury Wallet** (loaded from `TREASURY_EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`)
   - Holds ETH for gas fees
   - Holds ERC20 tokens for settlement

2. **Peer Wallet Generation**
   - Auto-generated if not provided in environment
   - Each peer receives unique Ethereum address

3. **Funding Transactions**
   - ETH sent to each peer for gas (default: 0.1 ETH)
   - ERC20 tokens sent for settlement (default: 1000 tokens)

4. **Payment Channel Setup** (optional)
   - Channels opened between consecutive peers
   - Initial deposit: settlementThreshold × 10
   - Automatic refunding when balance low

### Claim-Based Settlement (Epic 17)

The network uses **BTP Off-Chain Claim Exchange Protocol** to exchange cryptographic settlement proofs between peers without on-chain transactions until channel closure. This dramatically reduces gas costs and increases settlement throughput.

**Off-Chain Balance Proofs:**

```typescript
interface BalanceProof {
  channelId: string; // Payment channel identifier
  nonce: number; // Monotonically increasing
  transferredAmount: bigint; // Cumulative transferred
  lockedAmount: bigint; // Amount in pending HTLCs
  locksRoot: string; // Merkle root of locks
}
```

**Signing Process (via ClaimSender):**

1. Create claim message from balance proof
2. Sign with KeyManager (supports HSM/KMS)
3. Send claim to peer via BTP `payment-channel-claim` sub-protocol
4. Peer verifies claim signature via ClaimReceiver
5. Submit to blockchain only on dispute or channel closure

**Claim Exchange Flow:**

```
Connector A                     Connector B
───────────                     ───────────
Settlement threshold reached
    ↓
Sign claim (XRP/EVM/Aptos)
    ↓
ClaimSender.send()
    ↓
BTP WebSocket ─────────────→ ClaimReceiver.handle()
                                    ↓
                             Verify signature
                                    ↓
                             Store in database
                                    ↓
                             ClaimRedemptionService (polls)
                                    ↓
                             Submit to blockchain (if profitable)
```

**Verification:**

- Each peer verifies received balance proofs via ClaimReceiver
- Checks signature validity (ed25519 for XRP, secp256k1 for EVM/Aptos)
- Ensures monotonic nonce increase (prevents replay attacks)
- Validates transferred amount ≤ channel capacity
- Automatic redemption via ClaimRedemptionService when gas costs favorable

## Deployment Steps

### Automated Deployment

```bash
# One command does everything
./scripts/deploy-5-peer-multihop.sh
```

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# 1. Start network
docker-compose -f docker-compose-5-peer-multihop.yml up -d

# 2. Fund peers
cd tools/fund-peers
npm install && npm run build
npm run fund -- --peers peer1,peer2,peer3,peer4,peer5

# 3. Send test packet
cd ../send-packet
npm run send -- -c ws://localhost:3000 -d g.peer5.dest -a 1000000
```

## Verification

### Log Analysis

Each peer logs key events:

**PREPARE forwarding:**

```json
{"level":"info","msg":"Packet received","destination":"g.peer5.dest"}
{"level":"info","msg":"Routing decision","nextHop":"peer2"}
{"level":"info","msg":"Forwarding packet","peer":"peer2"}
```

**FULFILL propagation:**

```json
{"level":"info","msg":"Received FULFILL","fulfillment":"..."}
{"level":"info","msg":"Forwarding FULFILL upstream","peer":"peer1"}
```

### Success Criteria

✓ All 5 peers started and healthy
✓ Peer1-4 forwarded PREPARE packet
✓ Peer5 delivered packet locally
✓ FULFILL returned through all hops
✓ No packet rejections or timeouts
