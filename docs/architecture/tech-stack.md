**Important Notes:**

1. **External APIs Required:** XRP Ledger testnet/mainnet, EVM-compatible blockchains (Ethereum, Sepolia, etc.), Aptos testnet/mainnet
2. **Monorepo Package Structure:**
   - `packages/connector` - Production ILP connector (@crosstown/connector npm package)
   - `packages/connector/explorer-ui` - Built-in React visualization UI (embedded)
   - `packages/shared` - Shared TypeScript types and utilities (@crosstown/shared npm package)
   - `packages/contracts` - Ethereum Solidity smart contracts (TokenNetwork, AGENT ERC20)
   - `packages/contracts-aptos` - Aptos Move smart contracts (payment channels)
   - `packages/dashboard` - Legacy dashboard (deferred, superseded by explorer-ui)
3. **Published Packages:**
   - `@crosstown/connector` - Main connector library and CLI
   - `@crosstown/shared` - Shared types and utilities
4. **TypeScript Configuration:** Strict mode enabled across all packages, shared tsconfig.base.json in monorepo root
5. **Version Pinning Strategy:** Patch versions flexible (^), minor versions locked for stability, LTS/stable releases preferred
6. **Dependency Strategy:** Core dependencies required, peer dependencies optional (Express, TigerBeetle, better-sqlite3), AI features optional
7. **License Compatibility:** All dependencies MIT or Apache 2.0 compatible (open-source project)

**Tri-Chain Settlement:** Production connector supports three blockchain backends: Ethereum (TokenNetwork contracts), XRP Ledger (payment channels), and Aptos (Move contracts).

**Zero-Config Default:** No external databases or services required - in-memory ledger and file-based persistence work out of the box.
