# Sprint Change Proposal: Scope Reduction to Connector + Explorer

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Trigger:** User-initiated scope reduction
**Status:** Draft - Pending Approval

---

## 1. Issue Summary

### Change Trigger

The project scope is being intentionally reduced to focus exclusively on being an **ILP Connector implementation with Explorer UI**, removing all agent-specific, AI, Nostr, and advanced marketplace features.

### Rationale

- Simplify project focus to core connector functionality
- Remove complexity from agent orchestration, AI integration, and Nostr protocols
- Establish a clean, production-ready ILP connector with tri-chain settlement
- Maintain observability through the Explorer UI

### Current State

- 30 epics spanning connector, agent protocol, AI, zkVM, markets, streaming
- Significant code already removed on `epic-14` branch (per git status)
- README and docs still reflect full "M2M" vision with Agent Society Protocol

Establish monorepo structure, implement RFC-0027 (ILPv4) packet handling and routing logic with OER encoding, and deliver basic packet forwarding capability with unit tests and logging.

**Epic 2: BTP Protocol & Multi-Node Docker Deployment**
Implement RFC-0023 BTP WebSocket communication between connectors, create Docker containerization with Compose orchestration, and enable deployment of configurable N-node networks with health checks.

**Epic 3: Real-Time Visualization Dashboard**
Build React-based network visualization showing topology and animated packet flow, implement telemetry aggregation from connector nodes, and provide interactive packet inspection capabilities.

**Epic 4: Logging, Configuration & Developer Experience**
Implement comprehensive structured logging with filterable log viewer, add support for multiple network topology configurations, create test packet sender utility, and complete documentation for user onboarding.

**Epic 5: Documentation and RFC Integration**
Create comprehensive developer documentation explaining ILP concepts and ensure all RFC references are accurate, accessible, and properly integrated into the project documentation.

**Epic 6: Settlement Foundation & Accounting**
Integrate TigerBeetle as the double-entry accounting database, build account management infrastructure to track balances and credit limits between peers, implement settlement threshold triggers, and provide dashboard visualization of account states and settlement events.

**Epic 7: Local Blockchain Development Infrastructure**
Establish local blockchain node infrastructure with Anvil (Base L2 fork), rippled (XRP Ledger standalone mode), and Aptos local testnet via Docker Compose, enabling developers to build and test payment channel smart contracts locally.

**Epic 8: EVM Payment Channels (Base L2)**
Implement XRP-style payment channels as EVM smart contracts on Base L2, deploy payment channel infrastructure via Docker, integrate with settlement layer for automatic channel settlement.

**Epic 9: XRP Payment Channels**

**Epic 10: CI/CD Pipeline Reliability & Test Quality**
Eliminate recurring CI/CD pipeline failures by fixing test quality issues, implementing pre-commit quality gates, and establishing systematic testing workflows.

**Epic 11: Packet Explorer UI**
Deliver a per-node web-based explorer interface embedded in each connector that visualizes packets and events in real-time. Provides block explorer-style inspection for ILP packets, settlements, and payment channels.

**Epic 12: Explorer Performance, UX & Visual Quality**
Polish the Explorer UI with performance optimizations (60fps at 1000+ events), UX improvements (keyboard shortcuts, responsive layout), and visual quality refinements.

**Epic 13: Aptos Payment Channels (Move Modules)**
Integrate Aptos blockchain payment channels for settlement, enabling tri-chain settlement support (EVM + XRP + Aptos).

**Epic 14: Public Testnet Integration**

## 4. Recommended Path Forward

### Selected Path: Direct Adjustment / Integration

The scope reduction can be implemented through direct modifications to existing artifacts without requiring fundamental architectural changes. The core connector infrastructure remains intact.

### Rationale:

1. Core connector epics (1-10) are fully completed and unaffected
2. Settlement infrastructure (Epics 8, 9, 27, 28) remains intact
3. Explorer UI (Epics 14, 15, 29) needs only cosmetic changes (renaming, removing agent-specific features)
4. Code removal is already in progress on `epic-14` branch
5. No architectural rework required - just scope pruning

---

## 5. High-Level Action Plan

### Phase 1: Documentation Updates

1. [ ] Rewrite `docs/prd/epic-list.md` with 15 retained epics
2. [ ] Rewrite `README.md` to focus on ILP Connector
3. [ ] Update Epic 11 PRD (remove agent references)
4. [ ] Update Epic 12 PRD (rename to Connector Explorer)
5. [ ] Delete 14 removed epic PRD files
6. [ ] Delete/update architecture docs (agent-society, ai-skills, zkvm, components)

### Phase 2: Code Cleanup

1. [ ] Complete removal of agent/messaging/workflow code (in progress)
2. [ ] Update Explorer UI to remove agent-specific components
3. [ ] Rename "Agent Explorer" → "Connector Explorer" in UI
4. [ ] Remove TOON-specific rendering from Explorer
5. [ ] Update shared package to remove workflow types

### Phase 3: Verification

1. [ ] Verify all Docker tests pass with reduced scope
2. [ ] Verify Explorer UI renders correctly without agent features
3. [ ] Update CI/CD if needed for removed test files
4. [ ] Final documentation review

---

## 6. PRD MVP Impact

### Original MVP Scope

Full Agent Society Protocol with ILP + Nostr + AI + Markets

### New MVP Scope

**ILP Connector with Tri-Chain Settlement and Explorer UI**

- RFC-0027 ILPv4 packet routing
- RFC-0023 BTP WebSocket protocol
- EVM Payment Channels (Base L2)
- XRP Payment Channels
- Aptos Payment Channels
- TigerBeetle accounting
- Explorer UI for observability
- Public testnet support

### Impact Assessment

- **Scope Reduction:** ~50% (15 of 30 epics retained)
- **Completed Features:** All retained epics are already completed
- **New Development:** None required - maintenance/cleanup only

---

## 7. Agent Handoff Plan

| Role          | Responsibility                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Developer** | Execute Phase 2 (code cleanup) |
| **Developer** | Execute Phase 1 (doc updates)  |
| **QA**        | Verify Phase 3 (testing)       |

No additional PM/Architect involvement required - this is a scope reduction, not a redesign.

---

## 8. Success Criteria

- [ ] Epic list shows exactly 15 epics (all completed)
- [ ] README reflects connector-only focus
- [ ] No references to "Agent Society", "Nostr", "TOON", "AI Agent" in retained docs
- [ ] Explorer UI branded as "Connector Explorer" (or similar)
- [ ] All Docker tests pass
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline green

---

## 9. Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. Revert documentation changes via git
2. Restore deleted epic PRD files from git history
3. Code changes on `epic-14` can be reverted to `main`

---

**Approval Required:** User approval to proceed with implementation

**Estimated Effort:** Documentation updates (1-2 hours), Code verification (1 hour)
