```

**Key Directory Decisions:**
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#key-directory-decisions]

1. Monorepo with npm workspaces for simplified dependency management and type sharing
2. Clear package boundaries - connector, dashboard, shared are independently buildable
3. Co-located tests - test files alongside source for better discoverability
4. Docker configs at root for easier access (future stories)
5. Examples directory for pre-configured topologies (future stories)

### Coding Standards

**Core Standards to Implement:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#core-standards]

- TypeScript 5.3.3 with strict mode enabled
- ESLint with @typescript-eslint/recommended
- Prettier with line length 100 and single quotes
- Test file convention: `*.test.ts` co-located with source files
- `__mocks__` directory for shared mocks

**File Naming Conventions:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]

- TypeScript files: kebab-case (e.g., `packet-handler.ts`)
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `PacketHandler`)
- Interfaces/Types: PascalCase with `I` prefix for interfaces (e.g., `ILPPacket`)
- Functions/Methods: camelCase (e.g., `validatePacket()`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `DEFAULT_BTP_PORT`)

**Critical TypeScript Rules:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#typescript-specifics]

- Strict mode enabled in tsconfig.json (`strict: true`)
- No `any` types except in test mocks
- Use `Buffer` for binary data (not `Uint8Array` or `ArrayBuffer`)
- Async/await pattern for all asynchronous code
- Optional chaining for safety (e.g., `peer?.connected`)

### Testing Standards

**Testing Philosophy:**
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]

- Test-Driven Development (TDD) encouraged but not required
- Test Pyramid: 70% Unit, 20% Integration, 10% E2E

**Coverage Goals:**
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]

- `packages/shared`: >90% coverage (critical protocol logic)
- `packages/connector`: >80% coverage (core routing and BTP)
- `packages/dashboard`: >70% coverage (UI components)

**Jest Configuration Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]

- Framework: Jest 29.7.x with ts-jest for TypeScript support
- File Convention: `<filename>.test.ts` co-located with source
- Location: Same directory as source file
- Mocking: Jest built-in mocking (`jest.fn()`, `jest.mock()`)
- Test Pattern: AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) with descriptive test names

**CI Integration:**
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#continuous-testing]

- `npm test` runs all unit tests
- `npm run test:integration` for integration tests (future stories)
- Tests must pass in CI before merging

### GitHub Actions Configuration

**CI Pipeline Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#continuous-testing]

- Run tests and linting on pull requests
- Use Node.js 20.11.0 LTS (or matrix with Node versions)
- Include jobs for: dependency installation, linting, testing, building
- Security: `npm audit` in CI pipeline

### Project Structure Notes

This story creates the foundational monorepo structure. All packages will have minimal content (just package.json and basic TypeScript setup). Actual implementation code will be added in subsequent stories (1.2-1.7).

The focus is on:

1. Establishing the workspace structure
2. Configuring all development tooling
3. Setting up CI/CD automation
4. Ensuring the build/test/lint pipeline works end-to-end

No functional code beyond basic "hello world" placeholder is expected.

## Dev Notes - Testing

### Testing Standards

**Test Framework Configuration:**
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]

- Jest 29.7.x with ts-jest for TypeScript support
- Test files: `*.test.ts` co-located with source in same directory
- Coverage thresholds to configure in jest.config.js:
  - `packages/shared`: 90% line coverage
  - `packages/connector`: 80% line coverage
  - `packages/dashboard`: 70% line coverage

**Testing Best Practices:**
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]

- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test names: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`
- Mock external dependencies using Jest built-in mocking
- Cover edge cases: empty inputs, null values, maximum values
- Generate tests for all public methods and exported functions

**CI Testing Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#continuous-testing]

- All tests must pass before merging
- `npm test` executes all unit tests across workspaces
- Coverage reports generated and displayed in CI output
- Future: `npm run test:integration` for integration tests (Epic 2+)

**Test Organization:**
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#test-types-and-organization]

- Unit tests co-located with source files
- Integration tests in `packages/connector/test/integration/` (future stories)
- E2E tests will use Docker Compose (Epic 3+)
- Test helpers and factories in `test/helpers/` directories (future stories)

### Initial Testing Setup for This Story

For Story 1.1, the testing setup should:

1. Configure Jest with TypeScript support in all packages
2. Set up coverage reporting with appropriate thresholds
3. Create placeholder test files to verify Jest configuration works
4. Ensure `npm test` runs successfully (even with minimal tests)
5. Integrate test execution into GitHub Actions CI workflow

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-12-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** ⭐

This story delivers a solid, professional-grade monorepo foundation that exceeds expectations for a foundational setup story. The implementation demonstrates:

- **Architectural Alignment**: Perfect adherence to the specified source tree structure and tech stack requirements

The only issue discovered (Prettier formatting not applied) was minor and has been corrected during this review.

### Refactoring Performed

No significant refactoring was required. The codebase structure and implementation were already high-quality. The following minor fix was applied:

- **File**: Multiple configuration and documentation files (29 files total)
  - **Change**: Applied Prettier formatting using `npm run format`
  - **Why**: Prettier formatting check was failing, indicating files had not been formatted according to project standards
  - **How**: Executed `npm run format` to auto-format all TypeScript, JSON, and Markdown files per .prettierrc.json rules

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ PASS
  - TypeScript 5.3.3 with strict mode enabled
  - ESLint configured with @typescript-eslint/recommended
  - Prettier rules correctly set (line length 100, single quotes)
  - File naming follows kebab-case convention
  - No console.log usage (appropriate for foundational story)
- **Project Structure**: ✅ PASS
  - Monorepo layout matches docs/architecture/source-tree.md exactly
  - Three packages (connector, dashboard, shared) properly configured
  - TypeScript project references correctly set up for type sharing
  - Workspace dependencies properly declared
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ PASS
  - Jest 29.7.x configured with ts-jest support
  - Coverage thresholds set correctly: shared (90%), connector (80%), dashboard (70%)
  - Test file convention `*.test.ts` properly configured
  - Placeholder tests verify Jest setup works correctly
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ PASS
  - All 10 acceptance criteria fully satisfied (see detailed mapping in gate file)

### Improvements Checklist

**Items Handled by QA:**

- [x] Applied Prettier formatting to all files (fixed during review)
- [x] Verified all builds succeed across packages
- [x] Verified all tests pass
- [x] Verified linting passes with no errors

- [ ] Consider adding commitlint to automatically enforce conventional commit format
- [ ] Consider adding Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
- [ ] Consider adding VS Code workspace settings (.vscode/settings.json) for consistent editor configuration

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** ✅

- No hardcoded secrets or credentials in codebase
- `.gitignore` properly configured to exclude sensitive files (.env, credentials)
- `npm audit` shows 0 vulnerabilities
- GitHub Actions includes security audit job with `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`
- No security-sensitive code in this foundational story
- Proper exclusion of node_modules and build artifacts

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS** ✅

- Build time: Fast (<3 seconds total for all 3 packages)
- Test execution: Excellent (<1 second per package)
- TypeScript compilation: Optimized with composite projects and incremental builds
- Jest configuration: Proper test matching patterns avoid unnecessary file scanning
- CI/CD efficiency: Parallel job execution for lint, test, build, security, type-check

### Files Modified During Review

**Modified Files (Formatting Only):**

- `.eslintrc.json` - Applied Prettier formatting
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Applied Prettier formatting
- `README.md` - Applied Prettier formatting
- `docs/stories/1.1.story.md` - Applied Prettier formatting
- `tsconfig.base.json` - Applied Prettier formatting
- `packages/*/tsconfig.json` (3 files) - Applied Prettier formatting
- Multiple documentation files in `docs/` - Applied Prettier formatting

**Note to Dev**: File List section already includes all created files. The formatting changes above are cosmetic (whitespace/indentation) and do not require File List updates.

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** ✅ → docs/qa/gates/1.1-initialize-monorepo.yml

**Quality Score: 95/100**
