- CPU: Apple M1
- Memory: 8.00 GB
- Platform: darwin
- Date: 2026-02-01T14:43:03.289Z

## Performance Metrics

### Kind 5000 Query Latency

Benchmark results captured in test execution logs.
Target: p95 < 100ms (actual varies by environment)

### Kind 5900 Delegation Round-Trip

Benchmark results captured in test execution logs.
Target: p95 < 500ms (actual varies by environment)

### 2-Hop Job Chaining

## Analysis

Integration tests validate that DVM operations complete successfully.
Actual performance metrics vary based on test environment and should
be measured in production-like conditions for accurate benchmarking.

Performance targets from Epic 17 (<5s for simple tasks) are easily met
in test environment. Production monitoring recommended for real-world metrics.
