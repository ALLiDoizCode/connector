  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No new endpoints, auth changes, or data handling. Pure structural refactor."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Single additional module hop at startup — negligible impact."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Signal handlers, graceful shutdown, and error handling all preserved in main.ts."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear separation of concerns. lib.ts is pure re-exports, main.ts owns all lifecycle. Easy to reason about."
