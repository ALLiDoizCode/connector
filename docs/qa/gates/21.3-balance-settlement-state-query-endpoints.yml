  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All endpoints protected by API key auth middleware. Error sanitization prevents internal error leakage."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All endpoints are read-only GET requests with single-query delegation. No contention or scalability concerns at MVP scale."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optional infrastructure returns 503 gracefully. Error handling with try-catch on all handlers. TigerBeetle zero-balance semantics prevent 404 for unknown peers."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Follows established patterns from Stories 21.1/21.2. satisfies type constraint enforces compile-time schema compliance. Clean separation of concerns."
