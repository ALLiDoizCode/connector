  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Infrastructure-only story. No runtime code changes. Estimated ~5.9GB total memory."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Dependency chain correct: tigerbeetle(started) -> agent-society(healthy) -> agent-runtime(healthy) -> peer. Health checks appropriate per service type."
  maintainability:
