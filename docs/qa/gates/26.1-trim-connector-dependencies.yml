top_issues:
  - id: "CONS-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "xrp-claim-signer.ts retains top-level imports for ripple-binary-codec and ripple-keypairs (transitive deps of xrpl)"
    suggested_action: "Convert to requireOptional for consistency. Low priority — not reachable from lib.ts exports."
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "CONS-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "environment-backend.ts line 128 uses require('ripple-keypairs') instead of requireOptional"
    suggested_action: "Convert to requireOptional for consistency. Low priority — only reached when XRP key type is used."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security-sensitive changes. Dynamic import conversion preserves existing security model."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Dynamic imports cached by Node.js module system. Async factory patterns add negligible first-call overhead."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful degradation pattern tested — connector continues running when optional deps unavailable."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Consistent requireOptional helper reduces boilerplate. Clear error messages aid debugging."
