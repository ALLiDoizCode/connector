nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All address formats validated before storage. validateSettlementConfig() shared by POST and PUT handlers. No credential leakage in responses. Admin API remains internal-only."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "1-second setTimeout on new peer creation is acceptable for one-time operations. Re-registration (200 path) skips the delay."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling with try-catch in all handlers. BTP connection preserved on re-registration. Settlement config merge handles both existing and missing prior configs."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "validateSettlementConfig() extraction reduces duplication by ~80 lines. PUT handler follows same patterns as POST. Test file follows existing convention (admin-api-channels.test.ts pattern)."
