nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No secrets hardcoded. jq processes curl responses only — no user-controlled template injection risk.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Added jq calls are negligible (~5ms each) compared to Docker operations. Compose validation adds ~1-2s at startup.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Phase 5 now fails deterministically on zero channels (was "warn"). JSON validation prevents silent failures on error responses. jq prerequisite check prevents cryptic errors.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Changes follow existing script patterns. jq usage is idiomatic. Channel status values documented in story dev notes. Service count threshold (16) documented with update instructions.'
