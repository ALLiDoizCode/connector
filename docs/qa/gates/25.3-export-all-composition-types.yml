gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 7 acceptance criteria met. 15 value exports and 18 type exports verified via lib.test.ts (9 tests) and consumer-types.test.ts (10 tests). No internal types leaked. TypeScript compiles clean. Purely additive export-only changes with zero behavioral modifications."

    status: PASS
    notes: "No new endpoints, auth changes, or data handling. Only export statements added."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Export statements resolved at module load time — zero runtime overhead."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No behavioral changes. All existing 75 connector-node tests unaffected."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean export organization in lib.ts with logical grouping (classes, config types, settlement types, ILP types). Consumer-types test provides living documentation of public API surface."
