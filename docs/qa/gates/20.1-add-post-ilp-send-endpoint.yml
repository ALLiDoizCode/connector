nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Thorough input validation (ILP address regex, amount format, base64 round-trip, 64KB size limit). No injection vectors. No auth needed per architecture (internal endpoint)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient Promise.race timeout pattern with proper cleanup. Native crypto module for condition computation."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with try-catch, timeout handling, sender connectivity checks, and 500 fallback for unexpected errors."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns (handler class, pure validation function, pure crypto function). Full JSDoc documentation. IPacketSender interface enables easy mocking and future implementation swap."
