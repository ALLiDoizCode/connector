# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - "Clean React component architecture with proper TypeScript typing"
    - "Excellent accessibility: aria-labels, keyboard navigation, focus states"
    - "Security best practices: noopener, noreferrer attributes on all links"
    - "Smart UX: HexField expand/collapse doesn't trigger link navigation"
    - "Comprehensive test suite: 13 tests covering all acceptance criteria"
    - "Backward compatibility maintained via optional explorerUrl prop"
    - "100% requirements traceability (all 7 ACs mapped to tests)"

  code_quality:
    - "Follows existing FieldDisplay component patterns consistently"
    - "No linting errors in modified files"
    - "Proper mock isolation and cleanup in tests (windowOpenSpy.mockRestore)"
    - "AAA test pattern followed throughout (Arrange, Act, Assert)"
    - "Co-located test file per project convention"
    - "Uses Vitest framework (project standard) not Jest"

  compliance:
    coding_standards: PASS
