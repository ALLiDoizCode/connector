story_title: "Implement InMemoryLedgerClient"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 8 acceptance criteria met. 29/29 unit tests passing across 6 categories (accounts, transfers, balances, persistence, init guard, lifecycle). Zero lint errors. Clean implementation follows all coding standards with proper error class reuse, atomic validate-then-apply transfers, write-rename persistence, and zero runtime dependency on tigerbeetle-node."

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No network exposure, no user input parsing, no auth surfaces. Snapshot files contain only account IDs and balance numbers."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Map<bigint> O(1) operations. Dirty-flag optimization prevents unnecessary disk writes. Timer .unref() for clean shutdown."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Persistence errors caught and logged without crashing. Dirty flag retained for retry on next interval. Atomic write-rename prevents partial snapshot corruption."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean 350-line implementation. Well-structured with clear separation between account ops, transfer ops, and persistence. Reuses existing error classes. Comprehensive test suite."
