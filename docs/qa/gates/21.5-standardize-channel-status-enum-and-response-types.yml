    notes: 'No new attack surface. Unknown statuses default safely with logged warning.'

    status: PASS
    notes: 'Normalization function is O(1) for aliases, O(6) for canonical check. Negligible overhead.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Optional logger parameter prevents crashes. All error paths tested.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Single normalization function used consistently across all endpoints. AdminChannelStatus type prevents ad-hoc strings at compile time.'
