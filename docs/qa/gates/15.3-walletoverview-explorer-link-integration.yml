# Review Notes
review_notes: |
  EXCEPTIONAL IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY

  This story represents a textbook example of brownfield enhancement done right:

  1. **Pattern Consistency**: Developer clearly learned from Stories 29.1 and 29.2,
     reusing established security patterns, testing approaches, and code structure.

  2. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests (8/8 passing) cover all acceptance
     criteria with proper mocking and edge case handling. Zero test regressions
     across entire suite (323/323 passing).

  3. **Security Excellence**: Tab-napping prevention via window.open() with
     noopener,noreferrer; XSS protection through trusted URL generation; proper
     input validation throughout.

  4. **Smart Edge Case Handling**: XRP channel ID fallback to wallet address shows
     thoughtful problem-solving when direct explorer support unavailable.

  5. **Accessibility Built-in**: aria-label attributes, keyboard navigation support,
     proper focus states - not an afterthought.

  6. **Performance Optimal**: O(1) URL generation, React.memo optimization, minimal
     DOM manipulation - zero performance impact.

  7. **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, proper types, clean separation of
     concerns, follows project naming conventions.

  RECOMMENDATION: This implementation sets the standard for future stories in Epic 15.
  Stories 29.4 and 29.5 should follow the same patterns established here.

  NO CHANGES REQUIRED - READY FOR PRODUCTION
