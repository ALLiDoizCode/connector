# Review notes
review_notes: |
  Story 4.5 is exemplary documentation work that should serve as the quality standard for future documentation stories.

  Strengths:
  - All 10 acceptance criteria met with comprehensive evidence
  - User-centric Quick Start guide with realistic time estimates and expected outputs
  - High-quality Mermaid architecture diagram with color coding
  - Strategic placement of RFC references after Technology Stack
  - Excellent troubleshooting sections immediately following procedures
  - Table of Contents improves navigation for 1,266-line README
  - LICENSE file created (was missing, identified in pre-implementation validation)

  Zero Issues:
  - No code changes = zero regression risk
  - No security concerns (no sensitive information exposed)
  - No performance concerns (reasonable README length with TOC navigation)
  - No technical debt introduced (actually reduces debt by adding missing LICENSE)

  Educational Value:
  - "Why M2M?" section clearly explains project value proposition
  - RFC references provide path for users to learn official Interledger specifications
  - Architecture diagram makes complex system interactions understandable

  Ready for production with no additional work required.
