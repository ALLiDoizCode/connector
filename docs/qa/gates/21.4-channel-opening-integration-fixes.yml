nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Address format validation added for EVM/XRP. Peer existence check prevents orphaned channels. Error messages sanitized. Auth middleware inherited.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No performance impact. O(n) peer check on small set, O(1) metadata lookup, negligible regex validation.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Proper error handling: 400 for bad addresses, 404 for unknown peers, 500 for missing metadata. All paths have try-catch coverage.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Changes follow established patterns from Story 21.1. Clean one-line core fix. Tests well-organized into 5 describe blocks mapping to ACs.'
