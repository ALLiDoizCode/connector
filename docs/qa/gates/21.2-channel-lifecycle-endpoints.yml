  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API key auth enforced on both endpoints, error sanitization consistent, no user input used without validation"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Deposit blocks on-chain (documented design), close returns immediately for unilateral path, no N+1 patterns"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Cooperative close with unilateral fallback (AC 7), proper 503 graceful degradation for missing infrastructure, all edge cases handled"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "returnNotImplemented() DRYs Aptos 501 pattern, validateDepositRequest() exported and independently testable, satisfies type enforcement on responses"
