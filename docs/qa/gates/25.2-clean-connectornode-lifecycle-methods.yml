gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 8 acceptance criteria verified. Zero process.exit/process.on in library code, stop() is idempotent with guard, start()→stop()→start() reentrant cycle works, all settlement components shut down in correct order, 75/75 tests pass (67 existing + 8 new). Two low-severity future improvement suggestions noted."
