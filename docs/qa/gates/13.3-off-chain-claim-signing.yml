  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Uses standard ed25519 cryptography, separate key isolation (APTOS_CLAIM_PRIVATE_KEY), proper nonce tracking prevents replay attacks"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Synchronous operations with minimal overhead, O(1) state lookups"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling with typed AptosClaimError, graceful failure on malformed input"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-documented interfaces, clear code structure, comprehensive test coverage"
