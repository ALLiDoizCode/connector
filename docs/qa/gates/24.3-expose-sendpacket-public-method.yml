story_title: "Expose sendPacket() as Public Method on ConnectorNode"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 7 acceptance criteria met. sendPacket() correctly delegates to PacketHandler.handlePreparePacket() reusing all routing/validation/settlement logic. Comprehensive test coverage with 9 new tests, all 134 connector tests pass, TypeScript build clean."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "sendPacket() is local in-process API only; no new network surface; inherits all existing packet validation and credit limit checks from handlePreparePacket()"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Single Buffer.alloc(0) for default data field and one structured log call; hot path identical to BTP-originated packet processing"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "ConnectorNotStartedError thrown before start() and after stop(); unexpected handlePreparePacket errors caught and converted to T00_INTERNAL_ERROR ILP Reject; routing/delivery failures returned as ILP Reject (not thrown)"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Zero logic duplication — delegates entirely to existing PacketHandler; SendPacketParams provides ergonomic flat API; ConnectorNotStartedError co-located with ConfigurationError; all new types exported from index.ts"
