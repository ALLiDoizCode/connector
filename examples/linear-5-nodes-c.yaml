# Linear 5-Node Topology: Connector C (Middle Node)
# Topology: A ← B ← C → D → E
#
# This is the middle connector in a linear 5-node topology.
# Connector C connects to connector-b (upstream) and connector-d (downstream),
# acting as the central relay node.
#
# Network Flow:
# - Receives packets from B and D
# - Forwards packets destined for A, B to connector-b
# - Forwards packets destined for D, E to connector-d

# Node Identity
nodeId: connector-c
btpServerPort: 3002
logLevel: info

# Optional Configuration
healthCheckPort: 8080

# Peer Connections
# Connector C initiates BTP connections to both B and D
