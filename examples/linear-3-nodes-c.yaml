# Linear 3-Node Topology: Connector C
# Topology: A ← B ← C
#
# This is the last connector in a linear 3-node topology.
# Connector C only accepts incoming BTP connections from connector-b
# and does not initiate outgoing connections (peers array is empty).
#
# Network Flow:
# - Packets destined for g.connectora or g.connectorb are routed through connector-b
# - Connector B initiates the BTP connection to C

# Node Identity
nodeId: connector-c
btpServerPort: 3002
logLevel: info

# Optional Configuration
healthCheckPort: 8080

# Peer Connections
# Connector C has no outgoing BTP connections - it only accepts incoming connections
peers: []

# Routing Table
# All traffic for connector-a and connector-b is sent to connector-b
# Note: These routes will only work once connector-b establishes a connection
routes:
  - prefix: g.connectora
    nextHop: connector-b
    priority: 0

  - prefix: g.connectorb
    nextHop: connector-b
    priority: 0

  - prefix: g.connectorc
