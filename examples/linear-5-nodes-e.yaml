# Linear 5-Node Topology: Connector E (End Node)
# Topology: A ← B ← C ← D ← E
#
# This is the last connector in a linear 5-node topology.
# Connector E only accepts incoming BTP connections from connector-d
# and does not initiate outgoing connections (peers array is empty).
#
# Network Flow:
# - Packets destined for g.connector{a,b,c,d} are routed through connector-d
# - Connector D initiates the BTP connection to E

# Node Identity
nodeId: connector-e
btpServerPort: 3004
logLevel: info

# Optional Configuration
healthCheckPort: 8080

# Peer Connections
# Connector E has no outgoing BTP connections - it only accepts incoming connections
peers: []

# Routing Table
# All traffic for upstream connectors is sent to connector-d
