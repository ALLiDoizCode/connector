# Linear 3-Node Topology: Connector B (Middle Node)
# Topology: A ← B → C
#
# This is the middle connector in a linear 3-node topology.
# Connector B connects to both connector-a and connector-c,
# acting as a relay between them.
#
# Network Flow:
# - Receives packets from both A and C
# - Forwards packets destined for A to connector-a
# - Forwards packets destined for C to connector-c

# Node Identity
nodeId: connector-b
btpServerPort: 3001
logLevel: info

# Optional Configuration
healthCheckPort: 8080

# Peer Connections
# Connector B initiates BTP connections to both A and C
peers:
