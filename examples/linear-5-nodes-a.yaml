# Linear 5-Node Topology: Connector A
# Topology: A → B → C → D → E
#
# This is the first connector in a linear 5-node topology.
# Connector A only accepts incoming BTP connections and does not
# initiate outgoing connections (peers array is empty).
#
# Network Flow:
# - Packets destined for g.connector{b,c,d,e} are routed through connector-b
# - Connector B initiates the BTP connection to A

# Node Identity
nodeId: connector-a
btpServerPort: 3000
logLevel: info

# Optional Configuration
healthCheckPort: 8080

# Peer Connections
# Connector A has no outgoing BTP connections - it only accepts incoming connections
peers: []

# Routing Table
# All traffic for downstream connectors is sent to connector-b
