# Linear 5-Node Topology: Connector B
# Topology: A ← B → C → D → E
#
# This is the second connector in a linear 5-node topology.
# Connector B connects to connector-a (upstream) and connector-c (downstream),
# acting as a relay between them.
#
# Network Flow:
# - Receives packets from A and C
# - Forwards packets destined for A to connector-a
# - Forwards packets destined for C, D, E to connector-c

# Node Identity
nodeId: connector-b
btpServerPort: 3001
logLevel: info

# Optional Configuration
healthCheckPort: 8080

# Peer Connections
# Connector B initiates BTP connections to both A and C
