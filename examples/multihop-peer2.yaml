# Multi-Hop Topology: Peer 2 (Transit Node 1)
# Topology: Peer1 ← Peer2 → Peer3 → Peer4 → Peer5
#
# This is the first transit node in the multi-hop chain.
# Peer2 connects to both Peer1 (upstream) and Peer3 (downstream).
#
# Network Flow:
# - Receives packets from Peer1 and Peer3
# - Forwards packets destined for Peer1 upstream
# - Forwards packets destined for Peer3/4/5 downstream

# Node Identity

# Optional Configuration
healthCheckPort: 8080

# Peer Connections
# Peer2 initiates BTP connections to both Peer1 (upstream) and Peer3 (downstream)
