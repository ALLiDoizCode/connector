# Full Mesh 4-Node Topology: Connector B
# Topology: Each connector connected to all others
#
# This is connector B in a full mesh topology with 4 nodes.
# In a mesh topology, each connector has direct connections to all other connectors,
# providing redundant paths and low latency routing.
#
# Network Flow:
# - Direct routes to A, C, and D
# - No intermediate hops required

# Node Identity
nodeId: connector-b
btpServerPort: 3001
logLevel: info

# Optional Configuration
healthCheckPort: 8080

# Peer Connections
# Connector B connects to all other nodes in the mesh
