# Linear 5-Node Topology: Connector D
# Topology: A ← B ← C ← D → E
#
# This is the fourth connector in a linear 5-node topology.
# Connector D connects to connector-c (upstream) and connector-e (downstream),
# acting as a relay between them.
#
# Network Flow:
# - Receives packets from C and E
# - Forwards packets destined for A, B, C to connector-c
# - Forwards packets destined for E to connector-e

# Node Identity
nodeId: connector-d
btpServerPort: 3003
logLevel: info

# Optional Configuration
healthCheckPort: 8080

# Peer Connections
# Connector D initiates BTP connections to both C and E
