# Linear 3-Node Topology: Connector A
# Topology: A → B → C
#
# This is the first connector in a linear 3-node topology.
# Connector A only accepts incoming BTP connections and does not
# initiate outgoing connections (peers array is empty).
#
# Network Flow:
# - Packets destined for g.connectorb or g.connectorc are routed through connector-b
# - Connector B initiates the BTP connection to A

# Node Identity
nodeId: connector-a
btpServerPort: 3000
logLevel: info

# Optional Configuration
healthCheckPort: 8080

# Peer Connections
# Connector A has no outgoing BTP connections - it only accepts incoming connections
peers: []

# Routing Table
# All traffic for connector-b and connector-c is sent to connector-b
# Note: These routes will only work once connector-b establishes a connection
