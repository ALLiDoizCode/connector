# Full Mesh 4-Node Topology: Connector C
# Topology: Each connector connected to all others
#
# This is connector C in a full mesh topology with 4 nodes.
# In a mesh topology, each connector has direct connections to all other connectors,
# providing redundant paths and low latency routing.
#
# Network Flow:
# - Direct routes to A, B, and D
# - No intermediate hops required

# Node Identity
nodeId: connector-c
btpServerPort: 3002
logLevel: info

# Optional Configuration
healthCheckPort: 8080

# Peer Connections
# Connector C connects to all other nodes in the mesh
