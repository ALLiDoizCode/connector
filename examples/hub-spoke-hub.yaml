# Hub-and-Spoke Topology: Hub Connector
# Topology: Hub ← Spoke1, Spoke2, Spoke3
#
# This is the hub connector in a hub-and-spoke topology.
# The hub acts as a central relay point for all spoke connectors.
# All spokes connect to the hub, and all inter-spoke traffic flows through the hub.
#
# Network Flow:
# - Receives connections from all spoke connectors
# - Routes traffic between spokes
# - Does not initiate outgoing connections (peers array is empty)

# Node Identity
nodeId: connector-hub
btpServerPort: 3000
logLevel: info

# Optional Configuration
healthCheckPort: 8080

# Peer Connections
# Hub accepts incoming connections from spokes, does not initiate connections
peers: []

# Routing Table
# Routes for each spoke connector
# Note: These routes will only work once spokes establish connections
